# Managing-the-stuff-in-closets-using-STLs-and-BSTs
In this project, I have written a program that implements and manages several user defined BSTs. Each BST represents a container/location and the inventory of items it stores. This means that BSTs stores the name of the container/location and a collection of items; each item does have a name and how many of them are in the container. Also I have used the name of each item as a key for creating the BST; when a user attempts to add more of the same item, it automatically updates the item count through addition.
